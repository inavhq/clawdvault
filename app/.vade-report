## Vercel Web Analytics Configuration - Implementation Report

### Summary
Updated the Vercel Web Analytics implementation to use the correct Next.js-optimized import path.

### Changes Made

**Modified:**
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Updated Analytics import from `'@vercel/analytics/react'` to `'@vercel/analytics/next'`

### Implementation Details

**What Was Already in Place:**
- The `@vercel/analytics` package (v1.6.1) was already installed in package.json
- The `<Analytics />` component was already correctly placed in the root layout file
- Component was properly positioned inside the `<body>` tag after the children

**What Was Changed:**
- Changed the import statement from `import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/react'` to `import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/next'`
- This change aligns with Vercel's official documentation for Next.js projects

**Why This Change:**
According to Vercel's official documentation, the `/next` export path should be used for Next.js projects (both App Router and Pages Router) as it provides Next.js-specific optimizations. The `/react` export is intended for React applications that are not using Next.js.

### Verification

✅ TypeScript compilation passed (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
✅ The `@vercel/analytics` package contains the `/next` export (verified in package exports)
✅ Import syntax is correct for Next.js 16 App Router
✅ Component placement follows best practices (inside body tag, after children)

### Notes

- No additional dependencies needed to be installed - the package was already present
- The build failed during full production build due to missing Supabase environment variables (unrelated to Analytics changes)
- TypeScript type checking confirms no type errors were introduced
- Lock file (package-lock.json) was updated during dependency installation verification
